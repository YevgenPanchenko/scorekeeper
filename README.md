# scorekeeper
This is simple score keeper for ping pong, based on JavaScript, Html, Css and Bulma.
To choose how many points the game will go to, please choose from the drop-down list.
And then just add winning points by clicking on the button with the player's number.
When one of the players collects the maximum number of points, the counter automatically stops counting. 
Then you have two choices, either click on the reset button, or choose from the drop-down list
a smaller or larger number of points to which the game will go.
Here's the link to deployed version.
